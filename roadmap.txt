Client

TestInjector - App
    - cursor, selection, insert, delete

- Event System Wrapper (integrated with socket)
ContainerMove - Done
    - not working on mobile
ContainerSize
ContainerStyle (css tags)
ContentConfig (choose things like position: relative, etc, wrapping)
[core] AppManager (Load/Unload Start/Stop)

Server

1. Socket management - done
2. Persisting presentation to file (DONE)
 2.1 - slowness in persistence layer causes packets to be lost between clients. If you beam a website it won't make a perfect copy anymore (indincating some loss of packets)
 2.2 - Load presentations from file
 2.3 - Beam presentations to new joiners (should be done via HTML rather than socket.io events)
---------------------------------------------------------------------
- Roles & Permissions system per prezzo & object 
- Joining & Reloading presentation downloads the generated html file

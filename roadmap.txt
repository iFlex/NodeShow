Blocker:
!the node HttpDispatcher can't handle chunked requests apparently...
!Don't know if Socket.io will handle chunked events...

Current purpose:
Serve as a view controller for my newsstand application. 
It will receive updates in the form of HTML news bits which will get displayed on screen

Next Purpose:
Grow into a diagraming tool to represent systems

Stretch purpose:
Create 'living' diagrams (that can update themselves with status information) 
or even intaractive dashboards
Don't know for sure yet if this is feasable... (there are existing tools for such things already)

Client
-------------------------
Nice to have, maybe in the future whenever i have time:
TestInjector - [status: Partial implementation]
- Event System Wrapper (integrated with socket)
ContainerMove - Done
    - not working on mobile
ContainerSize
ContainerStyle (css tags)
ContentConfig (choose things like position: relative, etc, wrapping)
[core] AppManager (Load/Unload Start/Stop)

Server

Fix the aspect of chunked requests. Currently using httpdispatcher doesn't seem to support chunked requests.
Socket.io chunking?

1. Socket management

2. Persisting presentation to file (DONE)
 2.1 - slowness in persistence layer causes packets to be lost between clients. If you beam a website it won't make a perfect copy anymore (indincating some loss of packets)
 2.2 - Load presentations from file
 2.3 - Beam presentations to new joiners (should be done via HTML rather than socket.io events)
---------------------------------------------------------------------
- Roles & Permissions system per prezzo & object 
- Joining & Reloading presentation downloads the generated html file
